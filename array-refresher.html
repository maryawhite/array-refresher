<p>push adds to the end. pop removes from the end and returns the removed item.</p>
<p>JavaScript arrays have a forEach method that can be used as an alternative to a for loop.

</p>
<p>The forEach method on an array takes another function as a parameter and doesn't
    have a return value. The function passed to <strong>forEach</strong> takes in up to 3 parameters:
    <strong>element</strong>, <strong>index</strong>, and the <strong>array</strong> itself.
    We can refer to the function passed to .forEach as a callback function. The callback function will be called for every item in the array.</p>
<p>Naming convention for arrays: use a plural word for the array, and a singular word for each item
in the array.</p>
<blockquote> shapes.forEach(function(shape) {
            console.log('Here is a lovely shape: ' + shape + '.');
});</blockquote>
